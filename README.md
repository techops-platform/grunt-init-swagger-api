# grunt-init-swagger-api
This is a [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding) project for getting started with a swagger api, really fast.

## What it is
This is a scaffold project which will create an nodejs API application based on [restify](https://github.com/restify/node-restify) and documented using [swagger](https://swagger.io/)

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install grunt-init with `npm install -g grunt-init`

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/Stono/grunt-init-swagger-api ~/.grunt-init/swagger-api
```

_(Windows users, see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path)_

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init swagger-api
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
